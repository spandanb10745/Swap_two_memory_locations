# Memory Swap System in Verilog

This project implements a hardware-based system to swap the contents of two memory locations using Verilog. The design is developed and simulated using Xilinx Vivado. It consists of modular components: a register file, multiplexer, control FSM, and a top-level integration module. The testbench verifies the functionality of the swap operation.

## üß† Project Description

Two memory addresses `A` and `B` are provided. The control FSM triggers a swap between their contents using a sequence of read/write operations controlled through multiplexers and internal states.

### Features

- Modular, scalable Verilog design
- Controlled data swap between any two memory locations
- Simulated using Vivado testbench
- Clean waveform verification

## üß™ Testbench

The testbench initializes two different values at memory locations `A` and `B`, sets the `swap` signal high, and validates whether the values are successfully exchanged in memory.

```verilog
// Sample test sequence
addr_A = 2'b01;
addr_B = 2'b10;
swap = 1'b1;
// Observe memory values post-swap
